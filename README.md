# Relationship of some selected Prosper Loan Variables
## by Ismail Adamu


## Dataset

> The data set contains 113,937 loans, each with 81 variables including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, among others.


## Summary of Findings

> I chose the Loan data set for this project that has 113,937 observations and 81 variables. Without any prior financial knowledge, it was challenging to get started with so many variables. Understanding the meaning of each variable is thus necessary before beginning any data analysis. I selected a few of the variables that I was interested in after reading the descriptions and definitions.

>I took the next step after gathering some information about each individual variable and began to investigate the relationships among variables, particularly those related variables that were of interest. The most popular type of distribution display plot is a bar and histogram plot. I used scatter plots to visualize the correlations between the variables, and I looked further into the relationships of those with stronger correlations. Adding color to the plot is a quick and easy way to demonstrate relationships between multiple variables.

> Below are few reflections from the analysis
* The two income brackets with the greatest number of borrowers are 25k-49k and 50k-74k; they both have nearly the same numbers of borrowers.
* Also, The Loan status distribution demonstrates that completed loans are highest followed by current loans in terms of importance.
* Compared to current and completed loans, the number of defaulted loans is significantly lower. Loan cancellations are extremely rare. 
* The loan original amount and the borrower APR are negatively correlated, so the higher the loan amount, the lower the APR



## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I concentrate solely on the impact of income range on loan status, as well as the impact of loan term on monthly payment and loan amount.
After gathering some information about each individual variable, I went on to investigate the relationships between variables, focusing on those related variables that piqued my interest. A bar and histogram plot is the most common type of distribution display plot. I visualized the correlations between the variables using scatter plots, and I dug deeper into the relationships of those with stronger correlations. Colorizing the plot is a quick and easy way to show relationships between multiple variables.
